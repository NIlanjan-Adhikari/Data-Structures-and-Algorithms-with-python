    "# Deque\n",

    "\n",
    "Deque or Double Ended Queue is a generalized version of Queue data structure that allows insert and delete at both ends.<br>\n",
    "<b>Operations on Deque:</b><br>\n",
    "Mainly the following four basic operations are performed on queue:<br>\n",
    "insertFront(): Adds an item at the front of Deque.<br>\n",
    "insertLast(): Adds an item at the rear of Deque.<br>\n",
    "deleteFront(): Deletes an item from front of Deque.<br>\n",
    "deleteLast(): Deletes an item from rear of Deque.<br>\n",
    "getFront(): Gets the front item from queue.<br>\n",
    "getRear(): Gets the last item from queue.<br>\n",
    "isEmpty(): Checks whether Deque is empty or not.<br>\n",
    "isFull(): Checks whether Deque is full or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Deque supports both stack and queue operations, it can be used as both. The Deque data structure supports clockwise and anticlockwise rotations in O(1) time which can be useful in certain applications.\n",
    "Also, the problems where elements need to be removed and or added both ends can be efficiently solved using Deque. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deque (Doubly Ended Queue) in Python is implemented using the module “collections“. Deque is preferred over list in the cases where we need quicker append and pop operations from both the ends of container, as deque provides an O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to list which provides O(n) time complexity."
